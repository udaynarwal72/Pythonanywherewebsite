Project Name: Student Management System

Project Description:
The Student Management System is a web application built using Django, a Python web framework. It serves as a platform for students to manage their academic activities, including accessing timetables, tracking attendance, and finding available study venues. The system also allows administrators to manage student data and generate reports.

Features:
1. User Authentication:
   - Users can sign up for new accounts or log in with existing credentials.
   - Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access specific functionalities.

2. Timetable Display:
   - Students can view their personalized timetables based on their enrolled courses and sections.
   - Timetables display class schedules, including subjects, instructors, and venue details.

3. Attendance Management:
   - Students can mark their attendance for each class session.
   - The system calculates attendance percentages and provides insights into attendance trends.

4. Venue Availability:
   - Users can search for available study venues or classrooms based on date and time.
   - The system displays vacant venues, helping students find suitable places for self-study or group work.

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository_url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd StudentManagementSystem

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   (Linux/macOS)
   venv\Scripts\activate      (Windows)

4. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Database Configuration:
   - Configure database settings in settings.py (default: SQLite)
